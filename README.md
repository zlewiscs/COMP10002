Assignment 2 for subject foundations of algorithms

This project is a over-simplified implementation of the clustering technique in ML (No ML algorithms are involved),
in the context of social media users and the potential communities they had formed due to their connections.
The aim is to test the understanding of the features of C such as struct, typedef etc, as well as the ability 
to use them to implement abstract data structures such as linked list to solve problems efficiently. Although
dynamic memory allocation is not strictly required by the assignment, it is employed in my solution as I find
it to be more memory efficient, which also happens to be one of the main areas of learning for this subject.
